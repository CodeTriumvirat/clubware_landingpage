      <p class="text-lg">
        Founded in 2020 by a trio of full-stack developers over many,
        Clubware.io was born from a recurring pain we noticed in both our
        professional and personal circles—inefficient club management. As
        veterans in the industry, we leveraged our expertise to build a robust,
        user-friendly platform that goes beyond basic functionality. Inspired by
        our passion for new technologies and driven by a desire to innovate, we
        set out to create a solution that stands apart in flexibility and
        functionality.

      <h2 class="section-heading">Our Vision</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Our vision is simple: to provide rich, cutting-edge software that feels
        good to use. At Clubware.io, we believe that powerful tools should also
        be easy to use, thereby empowering the communities we serve to manage
        their spaces. We’re committed to continuous improvement and passionate
        about making user interfaces intuitive and simple. We embrace
        differences, and we’re redefining what management software can do.
